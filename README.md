# markers
There are situations when you do not have full control on camera software, but you need to:
1. find a center of an image
2. find a center of an image portion based on the image content (certain shape)
3. indicate to other people certain special positions (location of laser spot and etc.)

This program 'markers' is created as an overlay allowing the final user to perform these tasks.
